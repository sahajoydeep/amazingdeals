            <p className="welcome">Hi There, Welcome to my website Amazing Deals India</p>
            <p> My name is Joydeep Saha, I am currently a final year BSc CS Student at BITS-Pilani, I do web develping in my free
                time as my hobby, finding my ways to get cheaper products and all, I met with an influencer than I knew, that you can many
                items from Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho and other places for very cheap.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="description">
            <p className="question">How this works?</p>

            <p>Well, after talking with many people, one day I come across an influencer randomly at an event, where I found out that
            they have cetain connetions, where sellers provide them cetain products for completely free for promotion, but you might think
            what is it to me? right. I'm, not an influencer, trust me netiehr I am, but then, there are sellers who just listed their products
            to amazon, flipkart and all,  where they need good ratings and all, for which, you order from amazon that product, and the seller reimburses
            the ammount you paid, like you can get a 650 worth moisturerizer for completley free or just 59 INR.</p>

            <p>You fill out some form, after ordering, then after receving the order, you submit review or rating, and then you submit the refund form.
            All though, due to high number of forms and process, it takes about a month, but you do get it.</p>

            So, I'm just sharing them with everyone, and my connections with differencet sellers and helping everyone.
